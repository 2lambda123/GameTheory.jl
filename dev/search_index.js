Given a randomly generated tournament graph on the n nodes, the payoff for player 1 is 1 if, in the tournament, the node chosen by player 1 dominates all the nodes in the k-subset chosen by player 2. The payoff for player 2 is 1 if player 2's k-subset contains player 1's chosen node.\n\nNotes\n\nThe actions of player 2 are ordered according to the combinatorial number system, which is different from the order used in the original library in C.\n\nArguments\n\nn::Integer : Number of nodes in the tournament graph.\nk::Integer : Size of subsets of nodes in the tournament graph.\nseed::Integer=-1: Seed for random number generator. If seed is negative, then GLOBAL_RNG is used.\n\nReturns\n\ng::NormalFormGame\n\nExamples\n\njulia> seed = 1234;\n\njulia> g = tournament_game(5, 2; seed=seed)\n5×10 NormalFormGame{2,Float64}\n\njulia> g.players[1]\n5×10 Player{2,Float64}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  1.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n\njulia> g.players[2]\n10×5 Player{2,Float64}:\n 1.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 1.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  1.0  1.0  0.0  0.0\n 1.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0\n 0.0  1.0  0.0  1.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  1.0  1.0  0.0\n 1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0\n 0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  1.0\n 0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  1.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/game_generators.html#Games.Generators.unit_vector_game-Tuple{Random.AbstractRNG,Integer}","page":"Game Generators","title":"Games.Generators.unit_vector_game","text":"unit_vector_game([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], n; avoid_pure_nash=false)\n\nReturn a NormalFormGame instance of the 2-player game \"unit vector game\" (Savani and von Stengel, 2016).
